.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgdal raster footprint\fP computes the footprint of
a raster file, taking into account nodata values (or more generally the mask
band attached to the raster bands), and generating polygons/multipolygons
corresponding to areas where pixels are valid, and write to an output vector file.
.sp
Since GDAL 3.12, this algorithm can be part of a \fI\%gdal pipeline\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBgdal raster clean\-collar\fP utility may be run as a pre\-processing
step to generate proper mask bands.

.sp
Example footprint calculated with default options of \fBgdal raster footprint\fP\&.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-of, \-\-format, \-\-output\-format <OUTPUT\-FORMAT>
Which output vector format to use. Allowed values may be given by
\fBgdal \-\-formats | grep vector | grep rw | sort\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-co <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control compression,
and whether the file should be tiled.
.sp
May be repeated.
.sp
The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Raster drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-layer\-creation\-option <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional layer creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the layer created. For instance,
the GeoPackage driver supports layer creation options to control the
feature identifier or geometry column name, setting the identifier or
description, etc.
.sp
May be repeated.
.sp
The layer creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no layer creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Vector drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.sp
Note that layer creation options are different from dataset creation options.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-output\-layer <OUTPUT\-LAYER>
Output layer name. Defaults to \fBfootprint\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-overwrite
Allow program to overwrite existing target file or dataset.
Otherwise, by default, \fBgdal\fP errors out if the target file or
dataset already exists.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-append
Whether appending features to existing layer(s) is allowed
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b <band>
Select an input <band> to be processed. Bands are numbered from 1.
Multiple \fI\%\-b\fP switches may be used to select a set of input bands.
If not specified, all bands are taken into account. The way multiple bands
are combined is controlled by \fI\%\-\-combine\-bands\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-combine\-bands union|intersection
Defines how the mask bands of the selected bands are combined to generate
a single mask band, before being vectorized.
The default value is \fBunion\fP: that is a pixel is valid if it is valid at least
for one of the selected bands.
\fBintersection\fP means that a pixel is valid only if it is valid for all
selected bands.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-ovr <index>
To specify which overview level of source file must be used, when overviews
are available on the source raster. By default the full resolution level is
used. The index is 0\-based, that is 0 means the first overview level.
This option is mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-src\-nodata\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-src\-nodata <value>
Set nodata values for input bands (different values can be supplied for each band).
If a single value is specified, it applies to all selected bands.
If more than one value is supplied, there should be as many values as the number
of selected bands, and all values should be quoted to keep them
together as a single operating system argument.
If the option is not specified, the intrinsic mask band of each selected
bands will be used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-coordinate\-system pixel|georeferenced
Target coordinate system. By default if the input dataset is georeferenced,
\fBgeoreferenced\fP is implied, that is the footprint geometry will be expressed
as coordinates in the CRS of the raster (or the one specified with \fI\%\-\-dst\-crs\fP).
If specifying \fBpixel\fP, the coordinates of the footprint geometry are
column and line indices.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dst\-crs <CRS_DEF>
Target CRS of the output file.  The <CRS_DEF> may be any of
the usual GDAL/OGR forms, complete WKT, PROJ.4, EPSG:n or a file containing
the WKT.
Specifying this option implies \fB\-\-coordinate\-system=georeferenced\fP\&.
The footprint is reprojected from the CRS of the source raster to the
specified CRS.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-split\-multipolygons
When specified, multipolygons are split as several features each with one
single polygon.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-convex\-hull
When specified, the convex hull of (multi)polygons is computed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-densify\-distance <value>
The specified value of this option is the maximum distance between 2
consecutive points of the output geometry.
The unit of the distance is in pixels if \fI\%\-\-coordinate\-system\fP equals \fBpixel\fP,
or otherwise in georeferenced units of the source raster.
This option is applied before the reprojection implied by \fI\%\-\-dst\-crs\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-simplify\-tolerance <value>
The specified value of this option is the tolerance used to merge
consecutive points of the output geometry using the
\fI\%OGRGeometry::Simplify()\fP method.
The unit of the distance is in pixels if \fI\%\-\-coordinate\-system\fP equals \fBpixel\fP,
or otherwise in georeferenced units of the target vector dataset.
This option is applied after the reprojection implied by \fI\%\-\-dst\-crs\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-min\-ring\-area <value>
Minimum value for the area of a ring
The unit of the area is in square pixels if \fI\%\-\-coordinate\-system\fP equals \fBpixel\fP,
or otherwise in georeferenced units of the target vector dataset.
This option is applied after the reprojection implied by \fI\%\-\-dst\-crs\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-points <value>|unlimited
Maximum number of points of each output geometry (not counting the closing
point of each ring, which is always identical to the first point).
The default value is 100. \fBunlimited\fP can be used to remove that limitation.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-location\-field <field_name>
Specifies the name of the field in the resulting vector dataset where the
path of the input dataset will be stored. The default field name is
\(dqlocation\(dq. To prevent writing the path of the input dataset, use
\fI\%\-\-no\-location\-field\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-location\-field
Turns off the writing of the path of the input dataset as a field in the
output vector dataset.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-absolute\-path
Enables writing the absolute path of the input dataset. By default, the
filename is written in the location field exactly as specified on the
command line.

.SH GDALG OUTPUT (ON-THE-FLY / STREAMED DATASET)
.sp
This program supports serializing the command line as a JSON file using the \fBGDALG\fP output format.
The resulting file can then be opened as a vector dataset using the
\fI\%GDALG: GDAL Streamed Algorithm\fP driver, and apply the specified pipeline in a on\-the\-fly /
streamed way.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
However this algorithm is not natively streaming compatible. Consequently a
in\-memory temporary dataset will be generated, which may cause significant processing
time at opening.
