.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgdal vsi sync\fP synchronize files and directories located on \fI\%GDAL Virtual File Systems (compressed, network hosted, etc...): /vsimem, /vsizip, /vsitar, /vsicurl, ...\fP\&.
.sp
This is an analog to the UNIX \fBrsync\fP command. In the current implementation,
\fBrsync\fP would be more efficient for local file copying, but \fBgdal vsi sync\fP main
interest is when the source or target is a remote
file system like /vsis3/ or /vsigs/, in which case it can take into account
the timestamps of the files (or optionally the ETag/MD5Sum) to avoid
unneeded copy operations.
.sp
This is implemented efficiently for:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
local filesystem <\-\-> remote filesystem.
.IP \(bu 2
remote filesystem <\-\-> remote filesystem, where the source and target remote
filesystems are the same and one of /vsis3/, /vsigs/ or /vsiaz/.
Or when the target is /vsiaz/ and the source is /vsis3/, /vsigs/, /vsiadls/ or /vsicurl/
.UNINDENT
.sp
Similarly to \fBrsync\fP behavior, if the source filename ends with a slash,
it means that the content of the directory must be copied, but not the
directory name. For example, assuming \fB/home/even/foo\fP contains a file \fBbar\fP,
\fBgdal vsi sync \-r /home/even/foo/ /mnt/media\fP will create a \fB/mnt/media/bar\fP
file. Whereas \fBgdal vsi sync \-r /home/even/foo /mnt/media\fP will create a
\fB/mnt/media/foo\fP directory which contains a \fBbar\fP file.
.sp
This is implemented by \fI\%VSISync()\fP\&.
.SS Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-recursive
Synchronize recursively.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-strategy timestamp|ETag|overwrite
Determines which criterion is used to determine if a target file must be
replaced when it already exists and has the same file size as the source.
Only applies for a source or target being a network filesystem.
.sp
The default is \fBtimestamp\fP (similarly to how \fBaws s3 sync\fP works).
For an upload operation, a remote file is replaced if it has a different size
or if it is older than the source.
For a download operation, a local file is  replaced if it has a different
size or if it is newer than the remote file.
.sp
The \fBETag\fP strategy assumes that the ETag metadata of the remote file is
the MD5Sum of the file content, which is only true in the case of /vsis3/
for files not using KMS server side encryption and uploaded in a single
PUT operation (so smaller than 50 MB given the default used by GDAL).
Only to be used for /vsis3/, /vsigs/ or other filesystems using a
MD5Sum as ETAG.
.sp
The \fBoverwrite\fP strategy will always overwrite the target file with the
source one.
