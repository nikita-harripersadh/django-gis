.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgdal raster aspect\fP generates an aspect map, from any
GDAL\-supported elevation raster.
.sp
This subcommand is also available as a potential step of \fI\%gdal raster pipeline\fP
.sp
It outputs a 32\-bit float raster with values between 0° and 360° representing
the azimuth that slopes are facing. The definition of the azimuth is such that:
\- 0° means that the slope is facing the North,
\- 90° it\(aqs facing the East,
\- 180° it\(aqs facing the South
\- and 270° it\(aqs facing the West (provided that the top of your input raster is north oriented).
.sp
The aspect value \-9999 is used as the nodata value to indicate undefined aspect in flat areas with slope=0.
.sp
A nodata value in the target dataset will also be emitted if at least one pixel set to the nodata value is found in the
3x3 window centered around each source pixel. By default, the algorithm will
compute values at image edges or if a nodata value is found in the 3x3 window,
by interpolating missing values, unless \fI\%\-\-no\-edges\fP is specified, in
which case a 1\-pixel border around the image will be set with the nodata value.
.SS Standard options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-of, \-\-format, \-\-output\-format <OUTPUT\-FORMAT>
Which output raster format to use. Allowed values may be given by
\fBgdal \-\-formats | grep raster | grep rw | sort\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-co <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control compression,
and whether the file should be tiled.
.sp
May be repeated.
.sp
The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Raster drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.

.TP
.B \-\-overwrite
Allow program to overwrite existing target file or dataset.
Otherwise, by default, \fBgdal\fP errors out if the target file or
dataset already exists.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-band <BAND>
Index (starting at 1) of the band to which the aspect must be computed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-convention azimuth|trigonometric\-angle
Convention for output angles.
.sp
Defaults to \fBazimuth\fP, that is to say:
\- 0° means that the slope is facing the North,
\- 90° it\(aqs facing the East,
\- 180° it\(aqs facing the South
\- and 270° it\(aqs facing the West (provided that the top of your input raster is north oriented).
.sp
If set to \fBtrigonometric\-angle\fP,
\- 0° means that the slope is facing the East,
\- 90° it\(aqs facing the North,
\- 180° it\(aqs facing the West
\- and 270° it\(aqs facing the South
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-gradient\-alg Horn|ZevenbergenThorne
Algorithm used to compute terrain gradient. The default is \fBHorn\fP\&.
The literature suggests Zevenbergen & Thorne to be more suited to smooth
landscapes, whereas Horn\(aqs formula to perform better on rougher terrain.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-zero\-for\-flat
Whether to output zero for flat areas. By default, flat areas where the slope
is null will be assigned a nodata value (\-9999). When setting this option,
they are set to 0.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-edges
Do not try to interpolate values at dataset edges or close to nodata values
.UNINDENT
.SH GDALG OUTPUT (ON-THE-FLY / STREAMED DATASET)
.sp
This program supports serializing the command line as a JSON file using the \fBGDALG\fP output format.
The resulting file can then be opened as a raster dataset using the
\fI\%GDALG: GDAL Streamed Algorithm\fP driver, and apply the specified pipeline in a on\-the\-fly /
streamed way.
