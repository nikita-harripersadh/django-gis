.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This program builds a \fI\%VRT (Virtual Dataset)\fP that is a mosaic of a list of
input GDAL datasets. The list of input GDAL datasets can be specified at the end
of the command line, put in a text file (one filename per line) for very long lists,
or it can be a MapServer tileindex (see the \fI\%gdaltindex\fP utility). If using a tile index, all
entries in the tile index will be added to the VRT.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Starting with GDAL 3.9, for virtual mosaics with a very large number of source rasters
(hundreds of thousands of source rasters, or more), it is advised to use the
\fI\%gdaltindex\fP utility to generate a tile index compatible with the
\fI\%GTI\fP driver.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With \fI\%\-separate\fP, each input goes into a separate band in the VRT dataset. Otherwise,
the files are considered as source rasters of a larger mosaic and the VRT file has the same number of
bands as the input files.
.sp
If one GDAL dataset is made of several subdatasets and has 0 raster bands,
all the subdatasets will be added to the VRT rather than the dataset itself.
.sp
\fBgdalbuildvrt\fP does some checks to ensure that all files that will be put
in the resulting VRT have similar characteristics: number of bands, projection, color
interpretation, etc. If not, files that do not match the common characteristics will be skipped
unless \fI\%\-strict\fP is used.
(This is only true in the default mode, and not when using the \fI\%\-separate\fP option)
.sp
Starting with GDAL 3.12, a function (e.g., \fBmin\fP, \fBmean\fP, \fBmedian\fP) can
be specified (\fI\%\-pixel\-function\fP) to calculate pixel values from
overlapping inputs. If no function is specified, or in earlier versions,
the order of the input list is used to determine priority.
Files that are listed at the end are the ones
from which the content will be fetched. Note that nodata will be taken into account
to potentially fetch data from lower\-priority datasets, but currently, alpha channel
is not taken into account to do alpha compositing (so a source with alpha=0
appearing on top of another source will override its content). This might be
changed in later versions.

.B \-\-help\-general
Gives a brief usage message for the generic GDAL commandline options and exit.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tileindex <field_name>
Use the specified value as the tile index field, instead of the default
value which is \(aqlocation\(aq.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-resolution {highest|lowest|average|user|same}
In case the resolution of all input files is not the same, the \fI\%\-resolution\fP flag
enables the user to control the way the output resolution is computed.
.sp
\fIhighest\fP will pick the smallest values of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters.
.sp
\fIlowest\fP will pick the largest values of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters.
.sp
\fIaverage\fP is the default and will compute an average of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters.
.sp
\fIuser\fP must be used in combination with the \fI\%\-tr\fP option to specify the target resolution.
.sp
\fIsame\fP (added in GDAL 3.11) checks that all source rasters have the same resolution and errors out when this is not the case.
.sp
\fIcommon\fP (added in GDAL 3.11) determines the greatest common divisor of the source pixel dimensions, e.g. 0.2 for source pixel dimensions of 0.4 and 0.6.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tr <xres> <yres>
Set target resolution. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.
Both must be positive values. Specifying these values is of course incompatible with
highest|lowest|average values for \fI\%\-resolution\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tap
(target aligned pixels) align
the coordinates of the extent of the output file to the values of the \fI\%\-tr\fP,
such that the aligned extent includes the minimum extent.
Alignment means that xmin / resx, ymin / resy, xmax / resx and ymax / resy are integer values.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-te <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>
Set georeferenced extents of VRT file. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.
If not specified, the extent of the VRT is the minimum bounding box of the set of source rasters.
Pixels within the extent of the VRT but not covered by a source raster will be read as valid
pixels with a value of zero unless a NODATA value is specified using \fI\%\-vrtnodata\fP
or an alpha mask band is added with \fI\%\-addalpha\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-addalpha
Adds an alpha mask band to the VRT when the source raster have none. Mainly useful for RGB sources (or grey\-level sources).
The alpha band is filled on\-the\-fly with the value 0 in areas without any source raster, and with value
255 in areas with source raster. The effect is that a RGBA viewer will render
the areas without source rasters as transparent and areas with source rasters as opaque.
This option is not compatible with \fI\%\-separate\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-hidenodata
Even if any band contains nodata value, giving this option makes the VRT band
not report the NoData. Useful when you want to control the background color of
the dataset. By using along with the \-addalpha option, you can prepare a
dataset which doesn\(aqt report nodata value but is transparent in areas with no
data.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-srcnodata \(dq<value>[ <value>]...\(dq
Set nodata values for input bands (different values can be supplied for each band). If
more than one value is supplied all values should be quoted to keep them
together as a single operating system argument. If the option is not specified, the
intrinsic nodata settings on the source datasets will be used (if they exist). The value set by this option
is written in the NODATA element of each \fBComplexSource\fP element. Use a value of
\fBNone\fP to ignore intrinsic nodata settings on the source datasets.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ignore_srcmaskband
Added in version 3.3.

.sp
Starting with GDAL 3.3, if a source has a mask band (internal/external mask
band, or alpha band), a \fB<ComplexSource>\fP element is created by default with
a \fB<UseMaskBand>true</UseMaskBand>\fP child element, to instruct the VRT driver
to use the mask band of the source to mask pixels being composited. This is
a generalization of the NODATA element.
When specifying the \fI\%\-ignore_srcmaskband\fP option, the mask band of sources will
not be taken into account, and in case of overlapping between sources, the
last one will override previous ones in areas of overlap.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-nodata_max_mask_threshold <threshold>
Added in version 3.9.

.sp
Insert a \fB<NoDataFromMaskSource>\fP source, which replaces the value of the source
with the value of \fI\%\-vrtnodata\fP (or 0 if not specified) when the value
of the mask band of the source is less or equal to the threshold.
This is typically used to transform a R,G,B,A image into a R,G,B one with a NoData value.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b <band>
Select an input <band> to be processed. Bands are numbered from 1.
If input bands not set all bands will be added to the VRT.
Multiple \fI\%\-b\fP switches may be used to select a set of input bands.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-sd <n>
If the input dataset contains several subdatasets, use a subdataset with the
specified number (starting from 1). This is an alternative to giving the full subdataset
name as an input to the utility.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-vrtnodata \(dq<value>[ <value>]...\(dq
Set nodata values at the VRT band level (different values can be supplied for each band).  If more
than one value is supplied, all values should be quoted to keep them together
as a single operating system argument (\fI\%Example 4\fP). If the option is not specified,
intrinsic nodata settings on the first dataset will be used (if they exist). The value set by this option
is written in the \fBNoDataValue\fP element of each \fBVRTRasterBand element\fP\&. Use a value of
\fINone\fP to ignore intrinsic nodata settings on the source datasets.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-separate
Place each input file into a separate band. See \fI\%Example 3\fP\&.
Contrary to the default mode, it is not
required that all bands have the same datatype.
This option is mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-pixel\-function\fP\&.
.sp
Starting with GDAL 3.8, all bands of each input file are added as separate
VRT bands, unless \fI\%\-b\fP is specified to select a subset of them.
Before GDAL 3.8, only the first band of each input file was placed into a
new VRT band, and \fI\%\-b\fP was ignored.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-pixel\-function
Specify a function name to calculate a value from overlapping inputs.
For a list of available pixel functions, see \fI\%Built\-in Pixel Functions\fP\&.
If no function is specified, values will be taken from the last overlapping input.
This option is mutually exclusive with with \fI\%\-separate\fP\&.
.sp
Added in version 3.12.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-pixel\-function\-arg
Specify an argument to be provided to a pixel function, in the format
\fB<NAME>=<VALUE>\fP\&. Multiple arguments may be specified by repeating this
option.
.sp
Added in version 3.12.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-allow_projection_difference
When this option is specified, the utility will create a VRT even if the input datasets do not have
the same projection. Note: this does not mean that they will be reprojected. Their projection will
just be ignored.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a_srs <srs_def>
Override the projection for the output file.  The <srs_def> may be any of the usual GDAL/OGR forms,
complete WKT, PROJ.4, EPSG:n or a file containing the WKT. No reprojection is done.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r {nearest|bilinear|cubic|cubicspline|lanczos|average|mode}
Select a resampling algorithm. Nearest is the default
