.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgdal raster clean\-collar\fP scans a (8\-bit) image and sets all pixels that
are nearly or exactly black (the default), white or one or more custom colors around the collar
to black or white.
This is often used to \(dqfix up\(dq lossy compressed air photos so that color pixels can be
treated as transparent when mosaicing. The output format must use lossless compression
if either alpha band or mask band is not set.
.SS Standard options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-of, \-\-format, \-\-output\-format <OUTPUT\-FORMAT>
Which output raster format to use. Allowed values may be given by
\fBgdal \-\-formats | grep raster | grep + | sort\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-co <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control compression,
and whether the file should be tiled.
.sp
May be repeated.
.sp
The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Raster drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-overwrite
Allow program to overwrite existing target file or dataset.
Otherwise, by default, \fBgdal\fP errors out if the target file or
dataset already exists.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-update
If only an input dataset is specified, ask for it to be opened in update mode
If an output dataset is specified, ask for it to be opened in update mode
(this implies that it already exists).
Note that updating an existing dataset may lead to file size increase if
the dataset is compressed, and/or quality loss if lossy compression is used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-color <c1>,<c2>,<c3>...<cn>|black|white
Search for pixels near the specified color. May be specified multiple times.
When this option is specified, the pixels that are considered as the collar are set to 0,
unless only white is specified, in which case there are set to 255.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-color\-threshold <val>
Select how far from black, white or custom colors the pixel values can be
and still considered near black, white or custom color. Defaults to 15.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-pixel\-distance <val>
Number of consecutive transparent pixels that can be encountered before the
giving up search inwards. Said otherwise, the collar will be extended by
this number of pixels.
Defaults to 2.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-add\-alpha
Adds an alpha band to the output file.
The alpha band is set to 0 in the image collar and to 255 elsewhere.
This option is mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-add\-mask\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-add\-mask
Adds a mask band to the output file,
The mask band is set to 0 in the image collar and to 255 elsewhere.
This option is mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-add\-alpha\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-algorithm floodfill|twopasses
Selects the algorithm to apply.
.sp
\fBtwopasses\fP uses a top\-to\-bottom pass followed by a bottom\-to\-top pass.
It may miss with concave areas.
The algorithm processes the image one scanline at a time.  A scan \(dqin\(dq is done
from either end setting pixels to black or white until at least
\(dqnon_black_pixels\(dq pixels that are more than \(dqdist\(dq gray levels away from
black, white or custom colors have been encountered at which point the scan stops.  The nearly
black, white or custom color pixels are set to black or white. The algorithm also scans from
top to bottom and from bottom to top to identify indentations in the top or bottom.
.sp
\fBfloodfill\fP (default) uses the \X'tty: link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill#Span_filling'\fI\%Flood Fill\fP\X'tty: link'
algorithm and will work with concave areas. It requires creating a temporary
dataset and is slower than \fBtwopasses\fP\&. When a non\-zero value for \fI\%\-\-pixel\-distance\fP
is used, \fBtwopasses\fP is actually called as an initial step of \fBfloodfill\fP\&.

.SS Example 2: Create a new dataset, using black or white as the color of the collar, considering values in the [0,5] range as being considered black, and values in the [250,255] range to be white. It also adds an alpha band to the output dataset.
