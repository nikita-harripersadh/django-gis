.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgdal raster slope\fP generates a slope map, from any
GDAL\-supported elevation raster.
.sp
This subcommand is also available as a potential step of \fI\%gdal raster pipeline\fP
.sp
It generates a 32\-bit float raster with slope values. You have the option of
specifying the type of slope value you want: degrees or percent slope. In cases
where the horizontal units differ from the vertical units, you can also supply
scaling factors to account for differences between vertical and horizontal units.
.sp
The value \fI\-9999\fP is used as the output nodata value. A nodata value in the target dataset
will be emitted if at least one pixel set to the nodata value is found in the
3x3 window centered around each source pixel. By default, the algorithm will
compute values at image edges or if a nodata value is found in the 3x3 window,
by interpolating missing values, unless \fI\%\-\-no\-edges\fP is specified, in
which case a 1\-pixel border around the image will be set with the nodata value.
.sp
In general, it assumes that x, y and z units are identical. However, if none of
\fI\%\-\-xscale\fP and \fI\%\-\-yscale\fP are specified, and the CRS is a
geographic or projected CRS, it will automatically determine the
appropriate ratio from the units of the CRS, as well as the potential value of
the units of the raster band (as returned by \fI\%GDALRasterBand::GetUnitType()\fP, if it
is metre, foot international or US survey foot). Note that for geographic CRS,
the result for source datasets at high latitudes may be incorrect, and prior
reprojection to a polar projection might be needed using \fI\%gdal raster reproject\fP\&.
.sp
If x (east\-west) and y (north\-south) units are identical, but z (elevation) units
are different, the \fI\%\-\-xscale\fP and \fI\%\-\-yscale\fP can be used to set
the ratio of vertical units to horizontal.
For geographic CRS near the equator, where units of latitude and units of
longitude are similar, elevation (z) units can be converted to be compatible
by using scale=370400 (if elevation is in feet) or scale=111120 (if elevation is in
meters).  For locations not near the equator, the \fI\%\-\-xscale\fP value can be taken as
the \fI\%\-\-yscale\fP value multiplied by the cosine of the mean latitude of the raster.
.SS Standard options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-of, \-\-format, \-\-output\-format <OUTPUT\-FORMAT>
Which output raster format to use. Allowed values may be given by
\fBgdal \-\-formats | grep raster | grep rw | sort\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-co <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control compression,
and whether the file should be tiled.
.sp
May be repeated.
.sp
The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Raster drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.

.TP
.B \-\-overwrite
Allow program to overwrite existing target file or dataset.
Otherwise, by default, \fBgdal\fP errors out if the target file or
dataset already exists.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-band <BAND>
Index (starting at 1) of the band to which the slope must be computed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-unit degree|percent
Unit in which to express slopes. Defaults to \fBdegree\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-xscale <scale>
Ratio of vertical units to horizontal X axis units. If the horizontal unit of the source DEM is degrees (e.g Lat/Long WGS84 projection), you can use scale=111120 if the vertical units are meters (or scale=370400 if they are in feet).
.sp
If none of \fI\%\-\-xscale\fP and \fI\%\-\-yscale\fP are specified, and the
CRS is a geographic or projected CRS,
\fBgdal raster slope\fP will automatically determine the appropriate ratio from
the units of the CRS, as well as the potential value of the units of the
raster band (as returned by \fI\%GDALRasterBand::GetUnitType()\fP, if it
is metre, foot international or US survey foot). Note that for geographic CRS,
the result for source datasets at high latitudes may be incorrect, and prior
reprojection to a polar projection might be needed.
.sp
If \fI\%\-\-xscale\fP is specified, \fI\%\-\-yscale\fP must also be specified.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-yscale <scale>
Ratio of vertical units to horizontal Y axis units. If the horizontal unit of the source DEM is degrees (e.g Lat/Long WGS84 projection), you can use scale=111120 if the vertical units are meters (or scale=370400 if they are in feet)
.sp
If none of \fI\%\-\-xscale\fP and \fI\%\-\-yscale\fP are specified, and the
CRS is a geographic or projected CRS,
\fBgdal raster slope\fP will automatically determine the appropriate ratio from
the units of the CRS, as well as the potential value of the units of the

.B \-\-gradient\-alg Horn|ZevenbergenThorne
Algorithm used to compute terrain gradient. The default is \fBHorn\fP\&.
The literature suggests Zevenbergen & Thorne to be more suited to smooth
landscapes, whereas Horn\(aqs formula to perform better on rougher terrain.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-edges
Do not try to interpolate values at dataset edges or close to nodata values

.SH GDALG OUTPUT (ON-THE-FLY / STREAMED DATASET)
.sp
This program supports serializing the command line as a JSON file using the \fBGDALG\fP output format.
The resulting file can then be opened as a raster dataset using the
\fI\%GDALG: GDAL Streamed Algorithm\fP driver, and apply the specified pipeline in a on\-the\-fly /
streamed way.
