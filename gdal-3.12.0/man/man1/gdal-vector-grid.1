.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This program creates a regular grid (raster) from the scattered data read from
a vector dataset. Input data will be interpolated to fill grid nodes with
values, you can choose from various interpolation methods.
.sp
It is possible to set the \fI\%GDAL_NUM_THREADS\fP
configuration option to parallelize the processing. The value to specify is
the number of worker threads, or \fBALL_CPUS\fP to use all the cores/CPUs of the
computer.
.sp
Since GDAL 3.12, this algorithm can be part of a \fI\%gdal pipeline\fP\&.
.SH OPTIONS COMMON TO ALL ALGORITHMS
.SS Standard options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-of, \-\-format, \-\-output\-format <OUTPUT\-FORMAT>
Which output vector format to use. Allowed values may be given by
\fBgdal \-\-formats | grep vector | grep rw | sort\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-co <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional dataset creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoPackage driver supports creation options to control the version.
.sp
May be repeated.
.sp
The dataset creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Vector drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.sp
Note that dataset creation options are different from layer creation options.
.UNINDENT

Override the projection for the output file. If not specified, the projection of the input vector file will be used if available. When using this option, no reprojection of features from the CRS of the input vector to the specified CRS of the output raster, so use only this option to correct an invalid source CRS.

on the features to be used to get a Z value from. This value overrides the Z value
read from the feature geometry record (naturally, if you have a Z value in

containing a Z value).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-zincrease <increase_value>

.SH READING COMMA SEPARATED VALUES
.sp
Often you have a text file with a list of comma separated XYZ values to work
with (so called CSV file). You can easily use that kind of data source in
\fBgdal vector grid\fP\&. All you need is to create a virtual dataset header (VRT) for your CSV
file and use it as an input datasource for \fBgdal vector grid\fP\&. You can find details
on the VRT format on the \fI\%VRT \-\- OGR Virtual Format\fP description page.
.sp
Here is a small example. Let\(aqs say we have a CSV file called \fIdem.csv\fP
containing
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
Easting,Northing,Elevation
86943.4,891957,139.13
87124.3,892075,135.01

87077.6,891995,135.01
\&...
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For the above data we will create a \fIdem.vrt\fP header with the following
content:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
<OGRVRTDataSource>
    <OGRVRTLayer name=\(dqdem\(dq>
        <SrcDataSource>dem.csv</SrcDataSource>
        <GeometryType>wkbPoint</GeometryType>
        <GeometryField encoding=\(dqPointFromColumns\(dq x=\(dqEasting\(dq y=\(dqNorthing\(dq z=\(dqElevation\(dq/>
    </OGRVRTLayer>
</OGRVRTDataSource>
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This description specifies so called 2.5D geometry with  three  coordinates
X,  Y and Z. The Z value will be used for interpolation. Now you can
use \fIdem.vrt\fP with all OGR programs (start  with  \fI\%ogrinfo\fP  to  test  that
everything works fine). The datasource will contain a single layer called
\fI\(dqdem\(dq\fP  filled  with point features constructed from values in the CSV file.
Using this technique you can handle CSV  files  with  more  than  three
columns, switch columns, etc. OK, now the final step:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

This example creates a raster TIFF file from the VRT datasource described in
\fI\%Reading comma separated values\fP section using the inverse distance to a power method.
Values to interpolate will be read from Z value of geometry record.

This command does the same thing as the previous one, but reads values to
interpolate from the attribute field specified with \fI\%\-\-zfield\fP option
instead of geometry record. So in this case X and Y coordinates are being
taken from geometry and Z is being taken from the \fI\(dqElevation\(dq\fP field.
The \fI\%GDAL_NUM_THREADS\fP is also set to parallelize the computation.
