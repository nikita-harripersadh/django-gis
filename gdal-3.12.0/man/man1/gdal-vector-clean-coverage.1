.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgdal vector clean\-coverage\fP modifies boundaries of a
polygonal dataset, such that gaps and overlaps between features are removed and
shared edges are defined using the same vertices. The resulting dataset will
form a polygonal coverage that can be used with \fI\%gdal vector simplify\-coverage\fP\&.
.sp
This command can also be used as a step of \fI\%gdal vector pipeline\fP, although it
requires loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This command requires a GDAL build against the GEOS library (version 3.14 or greater).

.SS Standard options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-maximum\-gap\-width <MAXIMUM\-GAP\-WIDTH>
Defines the largest area that should be considered a \(dqgap\(dq and merged into
an adjacent polygon. Gaps will be merged unless a circle with radius larger
than the specified tolerance can be inscribed within the gap. The default
maximum gap width is zero, meaning that gaps are not closed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-merge\-strategy <MERGE\-STRATEGY>
Method by which overlaps or gaps should be added to adjacent polygons. Options include:
\- longest\-border (default): add areas to the polygon with which the longest border is shared
\- max\-area: add areas to the largest adjacent polygon
\- min\-area: add areas to the smallest adjacent polygon
\- min\-index: add areas to the adjacent polygon that was read first
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-snapping\-distance <SNAPPING\-DISTANCE>
Controls the node snapping step, when nearby vertices are snapped together.
By default, an automatic snapping distance is determined based on an
analysis of the input. Set to zero to turn off all snapping.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-active\-layer <ACTIVE\-LAYER>
Set the active layer. When it is specified, only the layer specified by
its name will be subject to the processing. Other layers will be not
modified.
If this option is not specified, all layers will be subject to the
processing.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-of, \-\-format, \-\-output\-format <OUTPUT\-FORMAT>
Which output vector format to use. Allowed values may be given by
\fBgdal \-\-formats | grep vector | grep rw | sort\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-co <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional dataset creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoPackage driver supports creation options to control the version.
.sp
May be repeated.
.sp
The dataset creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Vector drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.sp
Note that dataset creation options are different from layer creation options.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-lco <NAME>=<VALUE>
Layer creation option (format specific)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-overwrite
Allow program to overwrite existing target file or dataset.
Otherwise, by default, \fBgdal\fP errors out if the target file or
dataset already exists.
.UNINDENT
.SS Advanced options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-oo <NAME>=<VALUE>
Dataset open option (format specific).
.sp
May be repeated.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if <format>
Format/driver name to be attempted to open the input file(s). It is generally
not necessary to specify it, but it can be used to skip automatic driver
detection, when it fails to select the appropriate driver.
This option can be repeated several times to specify several candidate drivers.
Note that it does not force those drivers to open the dataset. In particular,
some drivers have requirements on file extensions.
.sp
May be repeated.
.UNINDENT
.SH GDALG OUTPUT (ON-THE-FLY / STREAMED DATASET)
.sp
This program supports serializing the command line as a JSON file using the \fBGDALG\fP output format.
The resulting file can then be opened as a vector dataset using the
\fI\%GDALG: GDAL Streamed Algorithm\fP driver, and apply the specified pipeline in a on\-the\-fly /
streamed way.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
However this algorithm is not natively streaming compatible. Consequently a
in\-memory temporary dataset will be generated, which may cause significant processing
time at opening.
