.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgdal raster overview refresh\fP can be used to refresh existing overviews
of a dataset.
By default all overviews are refreshed, but it is also possible to restrict
the refreshed overviews by level and/or extent.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dataset <DATASET>
Dataset name, to be updated in\-place by default (unless \fI\%\-\-external\fP is specified). Required.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-external
Refresh external \fB\&.ovr\fP overviews.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-resampling {nearest|average|cubic|cubicspline|lanczos|bilinear|gauss|average_magphase|rms|mode}
Select a resampling algorithm. The default is \fBnearest\fP, which is generally not
appropriate if sub\-pixel accuracy is desired.
.sp
When refreshing existing TIFF overviews, the previously
used method, as noted in the RESAMPLING metadata item of the overview, will
be used if \fI\%\-r\fP is not specified.
.sp
The available methods are:
.sp
\fBnearest\fP applies a nearest neighbour (simple sampling) resampler.
.sp
\fBaverage\fP computes the average of all non\-NODATA contributing pixels. This is a weighted average taking into account properly the weight of source pixels not contributing fully to the target pixel.
.sp
\fBbilinear\fP applies a bilinear convolution kernel.
.sp
\fBcubic\fP applies a cubic convolution kernel.
.sp
\fBcubicspline\fP applies a B\-Spline convolution kernel.
.sp
\fBlanczos\fP applies a Lanczos windowed sinc convolution kernel.
.sp
\fBgauss\fP applies a Gaussian kernel before computing the overview,
which can lead to better results than simple averaging in e.g case of sharp edges
with high contrast or noisy patterns. The advised level values should be 2, 4, 8, ...
so that a 3x3 resampling Gaussian kernel is selected.
.sp
\fBaverage_magphase\fP averages complex data in mag/phase space.
.sp
\fBrms\fP computes the root mean squared / quadratic mean of all non\-NODATA contributing pixels
.sp
\fBmode\fP selects the value which appears most often of all the sampled points.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-levels <level1,level2,...>
A list of overview levels to build. Each overview level must be an integer
value greater or equal to 2.
.sp
If not specified all existing overviews are refreshed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-bbox <xmin>,<ymin>,<xmax>,ymax>
This option performs a partial refresh of existing overviews, in the region
of interest specified by georeferenced coordinates, in CRS units.
.sp
\(aqx\(aq is longitude values for geographic CRS and easting for projected CRS.
\(aqy\(aq is latitude values for geographic CRS and northing for projected CRS.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-like <filename1>[,<filenameN>]...
This option performs a partial refresh of existing overviews, in the region
of interest specified by one or several filenames (names separated by comma).
Note that the filenames are only used to determine the regions of interest
to refresh. The reference source pixels are the one of the main dataset.
By default all existing overview levels will be refreshed, unless explicit
levels are specified. See \fI\%Example 2\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-use\-source\-timestamp
This option performs a partial refresh of existing overviews of a
\fI\%VRT \-\- GDAL Virtual Format\fP or \fI\%GTI \-\- GDAL Raster Tile Index\fP file with an external overview.
It checks the modification timestamp of all the sources of the VRT
and regenerate the overview for areas corresponding to sources whose
timestamp is more recent than the external overview of the VRT.
By default all existing overview levels will be refreshed, unless explicit
levels are specified. See \fI\%Example 1\fP\&.
